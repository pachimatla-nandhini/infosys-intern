# 🎵 Development of AI Integration in Music

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on the **development of AI-integrated music generation** using modern machine learning models and a user-friendly web interface. The application allows users to generate music based on text prompts, view generation history, and analyze statistics such as total generations and favorites.

The project is designed as a **beginner-to-intermediate level AI application**, suitable for academic projects, internships (Infosys / IBM / Cognifyz), and portfolio building.
