# 🎼 Development of an AI-Based Music Composition System

## 📌 Abstract

The **AI-Based Music Composition System** is a software application that uses Artificial Intelligence to automatically generate original music compositions. The system applies generative AI and audio processing techniques to create melodies and output them in standard audio formats. A user-friendly **Streamlit web interface** allows users to generate, play, and download AI-composed music.

This project highlights how AI can be applied in creative domains such as music, entertainment, and digital media.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

1. User accesses the Streamlit web interface
2. User triggers music generation
3. AI model processes and composes music
4. Audio data is converted to WAV format
5. Generated music is stored locally
6. User listens to or downloads the output
