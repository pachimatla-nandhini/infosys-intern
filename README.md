# 🎼 DEVELOPMENT OF AN AI‑BASED MUSIC COMPOSITION SYSTEM

## 📌 Project Description

The **Development of an AI-Based Music Composition System** is a comprehensive software solution that leverages **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Deep Learning** to automatically create original music compositions. The system is designed to simulate human-like music creativity by learning musical patterns, structures, and styles from existing data and generating new compositions based on user input.

This project is developed specifically for **academic learning and the Infosys Internship program**, focusing on practical implementation, clarity of concepts, and real-world applicability. The system demonstrates how AI can be integrated into creative domains such as music, moving beyond traditional rule-based composition techniques.

Users interact with the system through a **web-based interface**, where they can enter music-related descriptions such as mood, genre, or style. The AI model processes this input and produces a unique music composition, which can be played directly within the application. The system also maintains a record of generated music for analysis and learning purposes.

## 🎯 Detailed Objectives

* To study and implement AI techniques for automatic music composition
* To design a system that converts text-based descriptions into musical output
* To apply deep learning models for understanding musical structure
* To develop a simple and interactive user interface for music generation
* To analyze user interaction data such as generation count and favorites

## 🧠 Detailed Working of the System

1. **User Input Stage**
   The user provides a descriptive input such as *"soft instrumental music"* or *"energetic background music"*.

2. **Input Processing Stage**
   The text input is pre-processed and formatted so it can be understood by the AI model.

3. **AI Model Execution**
   A deep learning-based music generation model processes the input. The model has been trained on musical datasets to learn rhythm, melody, harmony, and structure.

4. **Music Generation Stage**
   Based on learned patterns, the AI generates a new and original music composition.

5. **Output & Playback Stage**
   The generated music is saved as an audio file and played through the web interface.

6. **History & Statistics Stage**
   Details of generated music are stored temporarily to display usage statistics such as total generations and favorite selections.
